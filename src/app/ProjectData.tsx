    projectDescription:
      "Agroforestry is a land use management system in which combinations of trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.[1] Agroforestry combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and sustainable land-use systems. There are many benefits to agroforestry such as increasing farm profitability. In addition, agroforestry helps to preserve and protect natural resources such as controlling soil erosions, creating habitat for the wildlife, and managing animal waste.[3] Benefits also include increased biodiversity, improved soil structure and health, reduced erosion, and carbon sequestration.",

    projectDescription:
      "The project involves the reforestation of previously degraded pastures with oil palm trees. This initiative aims to mitigate climate change by planting nearly 25,000 hectares of oil palm trees, which is expected to remove over 3.7 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere over 30 years. Additionally, the project contributes to the restoration of biodiversity, as oil palm cultivation on unused agricultural land reduces carbon emissions significantly compared to deforestation, and it fosters local sustainable development by providing employment and promoting social and environmental responsibility. The project transforms previously degraded pastures into a sustainable agroforestry ecosystem by planting oil palm trees, effectively addressing environmental challenges and promoting climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and community development.",
